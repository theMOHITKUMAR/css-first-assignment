        <p class="historycontent__paragraph--textmodifications">Google CEO <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Schmidt">Eric Schmidt</a> opposed the development of an independent web browser for six years. He stated that "at the time, Google was a small company", and he did not want to go through "bruising <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars">browser wars</a> ". After co-founders <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergey_Brin">Sergey Brin</a> and <a  target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Page">Larry Page</a> hired several <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox">Mozilla Firefox</a> developers and built a demonstration of Chrome, Schmidt said that "It was so good that it essentially forced me to change my mind.For more information click on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Chrome#:~:text=Google%20Chrome%20is%20a%20cross,it%20is%20the%20default%20browser.">more history</a></p>

        <p class="announcements__paragraph--textmodifications">The release announcement was originally scheduled for September 3, 2008, and a comic by Scott McCloud was to be sent to journalists and bloggers explaining the features within the new browser. Copies intended for Europe were shipped early and <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany">german</a> blogger Philipp Lenssen of Google Blogoscoped made a scanned copy of the 38-page comic available on his website after receiving it on September 1, 2008. for more click on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Chrome#:~:text=Google%20Chrome%20is%20a%20cross,it%20is%20the%20default%20browser.">more details</a></p>

    <div class="developments">
        <h2 class="developments__title--textmodifications">Developments</h2>
        <p class="developments__paragraph--textmodifications">Chrome was assembled from 25 different code libraries from Google and third parties such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla">Mozilla's</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape_Portable_Runtime">Netscape Portable Runtime</a> ,  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Security_Services">Network Security Services</a> , <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPAPI">NPAPI </a> (dropped as of version 45),<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skia_Graphics_Engine">Skia Graphics Engine</a> ,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQLite">SQLite</a> , and a number of other open-source projects. The V8 JavaScript virtual machine was considered a sufficiently important project to be split off (as was Adobe/Mozilla's Tamarin) and handled by a separate team in Denmark coordinated by Lars Bak. According to Google, existing implementations were designed "for small programs, where the performance and interactivity of the system weren't that important", but web applications such as Gmail "are using the web browser to the fullest when it comes to DOM manipulations and JavaScript", and therefore would significantly benefit from a JavaScript engine that could work faster. click on for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Chrome#:~:text=Google%20Chrome%20is%20a%20cross,it%20is%20the%20default%20browser.">more details</a></p>
